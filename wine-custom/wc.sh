# Script to convert a .pc folder into a .wine folder in Batocera and optionally compress it.
# Steps:
#   1. Select a .pc folder from /userdata/roms/windows.
#   2. Select the corresponding wine bottle folder (a .wine folder) from /userdata/system/wine-bottles.
#   3. Copy the wine bottle data into the .pc folder.
#   4. Delete the original wine bottle folder.
#   5. Rename the .pc folder to a .wine folder (in /userdata/roms/windows).
#   6. Optionally, offer folder compression (TGZ or SquashFS) with usage advice.
#      After compression, the output file is renamed to remove the ".wine" part.
#   7. Optionally, offer to delete the corresponding .wine folder in /userdata/roms/windows.
